So I was thinking about using the expected sales for training. I think we can't do it.

The reason is that our tests are artificial. We're testing on a random sample, 
which could be an issue from Jan 2006.
In our case, the expected sales of those from 2006 are probably relevant, but we're actually going to
be predicting sales for issues at the end of the slope, in 2010 / 2011. So the expected sales figures
from issues in 2006 just warps the model.
