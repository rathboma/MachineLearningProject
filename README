JAVA PROJECT
1) Open src/mlproject/Project.java and edit the image paths at the top of the file
2) run using the ./run script at the project root
	This:
		- loads all images and extracts their features\
		- combines image information with hand-annotated information from the csv file
		- partitions the images into test/training sets
		- runs the algorithms specified in Project.java
		
LUSH
execute:
%: lush
%: > (libload  "lenet5-magazine.lsh")
%: > (doit 10) ;; the number of training runs.

Again, image directories should be specified by editing the lenet5 lush file. By default the are ./small_covers_* so should just work
